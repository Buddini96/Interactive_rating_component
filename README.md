# Interactive_rating_component
ðŸš€**The challenge**

The Challenge is to build out this interactive rating component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I use HTML, CSS, and JS to complete the challenge. 

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on the device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
